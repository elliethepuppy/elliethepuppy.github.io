        on webdev<br />
        ========================================
    </h1>
    <p>
        as someone with no experience working in this field, but lots of
        experience browsing and using the web, allow me to make a claim
        as to the state of web development:
    </p>
    <h4>
        javascript is bad in general
    </h4>
    <p>
        i know. horror. shock and awe. terrible thing to say. javascript
        is the bedrock of modern webdev. it's the backbone of the modern
        web as a whole. this is the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        these days, it's not uncommon for a webpage to be completely generated
        by javascript. in one sense, this seems extremely efficient. no need
        to have someone work out how to make a page look a certain way, that's
        done by the js. same for everything else. unfortunately, running and
        holding all of these scripts takes a <em>lot</em> of data. megabytes
        worth of javascript coming down the pipeline to make the page look all
        pretty. the cost? load times, excessive use of system resources, and
        immense susceptibility to hacking.
    </p>
    <h3>
        who cares about load times and resource usage? who doesn't have gigabit
        internet and 128 gigs of memory????
    </h3>
    <p>
        me, <strong>fucker</strong>, that's who. i can't count the number
        of times i've loaded up a website and had to sit and wait---sometimes
        for upwards of <em><b>ten seconds</b></em>---for anywhere from several
        tens to hundreds of megabytes worth of scripts to be delivered to and
        executed on my machine. this is ridiculous. do not misunderstand me,
        either. javascript is really useful for beautifying webpages, which
        i generally think is fine. but when your literal entire website is
        written in and generated on-demand by the execution of a jenga tower
        of javascript, i start to look at you like you've lost the plot.
        what's so bad about typing a webpage out in your text editor?
    </p>
    <p>
        not to mention, you can't execute arbitrary commands when your site
        is written in html, with only visual elements handled by javascript.
        it feels backwards to chase beauty when not only is html with accent
        by javascript plenty beautiful, it is <em>simpler and less barrier-
        laden</em> for newbies to the field. it is nearly impossible to get
        a handle on webdev basics these days because basics have been supplanted
        in favor of stacks upon stacks of react and hooks and this and that,
        rather than the quite simple, less-obtuse-than-ever html5. pretty much
        every resource on html eventually directs the reader to one of the
        bloated javascript frameworks that have been pushed endlessly by
        multi-billion-dollar corporations, who seem to think that <em>they</em>
        know best for the web. an all-too-familiar sight, in my opinion.
        javascript frameworks do not exist to make webdev easier to learn
        or websites easier to use. conversely, it introduces massive barriers
        to entry to both learning <em>how</em> to use the tools, as well as
        <em>what</em> you can use to access the web. <em>simple web pages</em>
        are being used to artificially deprecate older computers so that
        manufacturers can push you to buy a new computer.
    </p>
    <h3>
        what can be done?
    </h3>
    <p>
        this. this website can be done. it contains no javascript components
        at all, but i'm not a complete purist. perhaps later on i'll include
        some inline scripts, or perhaps a site-wide script to handle mobile
        view. but i will never use react, i will never use angular, i will
        never infect this site with the very thing i think is making websites
        worse to use and develop. so go out there and write some pure html.
        it might just do you some good.
