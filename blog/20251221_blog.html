            so, i decided to install niri, following
            <a href="https://www.tonybtw.com/tutorial/niri/">
                this
            </a>
            tutorial on my fedora plasma laptop. it was quite a
            bit of a pain to do because there aren't official
            fedora packages for several of the pre-reqs, but
            ended up with a nice-looking and -feeling result
            that somehow bricked my plasma install, so now i'm
            committed, which is fine, honestly. i like it much more
            than plasma. noctalia shell is easily the nicest status
            bar i've ever used. and niri is quite simple to configure.
            <br />
            i like it quite a bit. highly recommended if you're
            looking for a nice lightweight window manager that
            stays the fuck out of your way and doesn't completely
            shit itself if you make a bad change to the config.
