            so i started learning crystal<br />
            ========================================
        </h1>

        <p>
            started learning crystal recently because i just happened
            to need to use the compiler for a tool someone made, and
            good god is it fantastic. i've been trapped in python land
            for so long. it's really difficult for me to get out of just
            writing python for everything. not that python is bad, or
            even that it's potentially "unserious" or something. i
            just have a hunger for something else that python can't
            fill. well, crystal does exactly that.
        </p>
        <h3>
            ====================<br />
            it's so simple<br />
            ====================
        </h3>
        <p>
            i simply haven't seen a fast-as-fuck, compiled language
            with the simplicity and ease-of-use that crystal has,
            and without compromising on power. its similarity to
            ruby (being crystal's primary inspiration, and even the
            original implementation of its compiler!) is so so so
            effective at making things not an absolute nightmare
            to parse as a beginner. i've tried (and given up on)
            lots of languages these past few years, but i'm all-in
            on crystal. it's just so fabulous to work with.
